Red Velvet Cake

ingredients:
Ingredients vary based on the era and area of the world.
Three red velvet cakes varying in the amounts of shortening, butter, and vegetable oil.
 All used red food coloring. 
 The reaction of acidic vinegar and buttermilk tends to better reveal the red anthocyanin in cocoa and keeps the cake moist, light, and fluffy. 
 This natural tinting may have been the source for the name "red velvet", as well as "Devil's food" and similar names for chocolate cakes. 
 Today, chocolate often undergoes Dutch processing, which prevents the color change of the anthocyanins.
  A reconstruction of the original red velvet cake involves reducing or eliminating the vinegar and colorants and using a non-Dutched cocoa to provide the needed acidity and color.
